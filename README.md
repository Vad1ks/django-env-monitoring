# django-env-monitoring

This project was created during my Master's studying programme

The project is about the environment monitoring. Data about several envorinment indicators(air, water, radiation pollution etc.) is stored in mongoDB, handled by python django backend and displayed for user using leaflet.js map and pure js frontend.

User can also add new point and indicator data and filter by indicator category

The skeleton for this project was taken from https://github.com/bugbytes-io/django-folium-example
